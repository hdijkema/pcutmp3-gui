===========

Perfect CUT MP3 is a perfect tool for cutting MP3 files using a CueSheet, 
and having a result without GAPS, because it enhances the resulting mp3
files with Lame tags for gapless playback.

However, PCutMp3 v0.98 BETA didn't properly cut 48.000Hz Mp3s and it
didn't have a GUI for editing CueSheets. 

This version does add such features.
